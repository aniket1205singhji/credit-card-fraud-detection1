#• Conducted extensive EDA (univariate & bivariate analysis) & preprocessed the imbalanced dataset using SMOTE technique
• Leveraged ML algorithms like Logistical Regression, KNN, SVM, & Random Forest, for prediction
• Compared the performance of the models based on F1 scores & Confusion Matrix & plotted ROC curves
• Logistic Regression was the best classifier based on ROC curves. Achieved classification recall up to 95% on SVC
